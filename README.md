# Algorithm-Visualizer
A JavaScript application that visualizes different sorting algorithms, using basic HTML and CSS. Visualizes the movements and swaps of indices within each algorithm along with sound to help as learning material. Plans to add more algorithms later, as well as make a more impressive UI.

This project was meant to help me brush up on DSA. As such, I used help in creating it with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AwSlHlpFuc . Other sorting algorithms were implemented on my own.
